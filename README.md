# Midterm Java Project
â€“ Valeriia Holotiuk

This is my part of the midterm project for Keyin College.

I created a menu using the Scanner class in `Main.java`, and built the `Doctor` and `Medication` classes with basic attributes and methods. 
The menu lets users view doctor/medication info and restock medication.
